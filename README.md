# What is the #AfricaVsVirus Challenge?
The Jobs for Youth in Africa Initiative of the African Development Bank is organizing the #AfricaVsVirus Challenge to create tech and non-tech solutions to some of the most pressing challenges posed by the novel coronavirus pandemic. We are calling on socially committed citizens worldwide, problem solvers, creative minds, health experts, programmers, graphic and web designers to come together in a 72-hour collaborative digital process.
Following the #AfricaVsVirus Challenge, the best solutions will be selected and will be fully implemented with partners and donors in Africa and worldwide.
